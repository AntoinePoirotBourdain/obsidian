## zen workplace 

 I spent some time setting up my perfect workplace, It maybe was too much but i feel in control of my computer again, I think it will be very good for the future (but I fear the days where I will have to use a non linux computer again). 

I came back to learning tricks on linux and other stuff

Also doing the routine helped me a lot for the day, i need to keep following it and getting up earlier, I start to become serious with my work and I think i can manage a loooot of stuff

## paper 

I need to go back to writing this fucking paper 
I think a good thing would be to write the part explaining the WCE model, and the part with the manual on how to use the model
